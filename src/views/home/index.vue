        London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in
        Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the
        streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the
        earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet
        long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill.
